## Monitoring checkout lines in retail with Edge Impulse and Renesas RZ/V2L :camera: :walking: :walking:

![Cover Image](media/cover_image.png)

### Quick start :computer:

You can find the public Edge Impulse project here [Person Detection with Renesas DRP-AI](https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/public/166649/latest)

Ensure you have a recent version of Python then install the Edge-Impulse Linux Python SDK : 
```
 pip3 install edge_impulse_linux -i https://pypi.python.org/simple
```

Next, install Flask which is required to run the application.
```
pip3 install flask
```

Clone the repository to your target board
```
git clone https://github.com/SolomonGithu/retail-checkout-lines-management-with-Edge-Impulse.git
```

Navigate to the repository
```
cd retail-checkout-lines-management-with-Edge-Impulse
```
Start the application by running the following command while in the root directory of this repo:
```
python3 app.py
```

Alternatively, this Flask application has also been built as an executable for aarch64 (or amd64) Linux platforms using PyInstaller. This executable is in the ```dist``` folder. Run the commands below to start the executable:
```
cd dist && \ 
chmod u+x app && \
./app
```

### Rebuilding the executable :hammer:

If you want to update the application and rebuild the executable ensure [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/) is installed. 

Since the RZ/V2L is of the AARCH64 platform, we need to ensure this is the target for the built executable. By default, the PyInstaller's bootloaders architecture defaults to the installed machineâ€™s platform. If you want to cross compile on a host computer you can do it by [building the bootloader](https://pyinstaller.org/en/stable/bootloader-building.html) for AARCH64.

Ensure that a terminal is in the parent directory of this repository and build the application with the command:
```
pyinstaller -w -F --add-data "templates:templates" --add-data "static:static" --add-data "modelfile:modelfile" app.py
```

If you see some warnings when looking for dynamic libraries in the build process, first run the command ```sudo ldconfig``` and build the application again.

Lastly start the application with the command :
```
cd dist && ./app
```

### Counting customers :eyes:
For counting the number of people at each queue, we need to analyze the x values of the bounding boxes and check if they lie in the x values of where the checkout lines appear in an image.

![Regions of interest](test_samples/Regions_of_interest.png)

For this demo, I will use the retail video [here](test_samples/Retail%20video%20credits%20Raul%2024-06%20GitHub.mp4). Using a reference image size of 1366x768 I calculated where the x values for each cashier's checkout lines seem to appear. In [app.py](app.py) the coordinates are mapped to the input image size of 320x320.

From left, we have cashier 1, then 2 in the middle and finally cashier 3 at the right. Based on the reference image resolution,  the regions of interest for each cashier's queue were found to be:

| Cashier Number | Queue region (x coordinates) |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 1              | from 0 to 101                |
| 2              | between 206 and 304          |
| 3              | between 398 and 468          |

Then from the Edge Impulse Python SDK we can check the x coordinates of the bounding boxes. 

The idea is that we need to know where our region of interest is with respect to the captured image size. Then from ``runner.classifier`` in [app.py](app.py) we can check where the bounding boxes are and increase the number of people at a queue based on this.

If you are using another video/image source then you will need to identify the location of the region(s) of interest.
